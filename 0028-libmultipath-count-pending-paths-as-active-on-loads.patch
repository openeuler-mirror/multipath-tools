Subject: [PATCH] libmultipath: count pending paths as active on loads

When multipath loads a table, it signals to udev if there are no active
paths.  Multipath wasn't counting pending paths as active.  This meant
that if all the paths were pending, udev would treat the device as not
ready, and not run kpartx on it.  Even if the pending paths later
because active and were reinstated, the kernel would not send a new
uevent, because from its point of view, they were always up.

The alternative would be to continue to treat them as failed in the udev
rules, but then also tell the kernel that they were down, so that it
would trigger a uevent when they were reinstated. However, this could
lead to newly created multipath devices failing IO, simply because the
path checkers hadn't returned yet. Having udev assume that the the
device is up, like the kernel does, seems like the safer option.
